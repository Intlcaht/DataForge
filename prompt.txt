a custom service for handling deploying resources like
databases, s3 buckets in different regions including local environments

features
admin has access to necessary administration capabilities
the system reads a config yml file containing resource specifications in different regions
it deploys the instances or set of them or one of them,
it can also restart, maintain or stop the instances
it can also scale the instances on demand
it will support many databases, postgres, mariadb, mongodb, neo4j, influxdb
it will support minio s3 buckets
it will support provisioning of databases with user accounts and access with least privilege
it will support configuring initial database structure (creating tables or nodes)
it will then provide connection info for this instances
it will integrate with teleport for usable use cases
it will have ability to apply controls to instances, 
controls like monitoring, access control ip list

it will also manage environment files for the apps registered to use the databases
i.e the developer will upload their .env file, the system will obfuscate the file and 
give the developer back the obfuscated file, the system will then have a 
go binary utility that the developer will run on their server and this 
will deobfuscate the file and export the variables to the system environment before the app starts
but leaving the obfuscated version unchanged
include suggestions on:
 🧱 1. Architecture Design

    Frontend/UI Layer

        Simple forms and wizards to let users define the stack.

        Option to choose from predefined templates (e.g., "Postgres + S3", "LAMP stack").

    Backend/API Layer

        Accepts user inputs and triggers provisioning.

        Communicates with Terraform and Docker.

        Authenticates and authorizes users.

    Provisioning/Orchestration Layer

        Manages infrastructure state.

        Executes Terraform scripts, Docker commands.

        Manages logs, errors, and rollbacks.

🧠 2. Tech Stack Choices

    Terraform: Provisioning infra (e.g., AWS S3, RDS, EC2, etc.).

    Docker: Containerizing services (e.g., MySQL, Redis).

    Kubernetes (optional): If orchestrating Docker containers in clusters.

    State Management: Terraform backend (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB for locking).

    Queue/Worker System: For background task processing (e.g., Celery, Sidekiq, BullMQ).

    Database: Store user projects, deployment status, history.

🔐 3. Security Considerations

    Secure API access (e.g., JWT, OAuth).

    Validate and sanitize user inputs.

    Handle secrets (e.g., using Vault, or parameter store).

    Restrict execution of Terraform/Docker to safe modules only.

🧑‍💻 4. User Experience

    Prebuilt stack templates.

    Stack designer (drag-and-drop or form-based).

    Feedback on deployment progress (via sockets or polling).

    Logs and error messages shown in UI.

🔄 5. Provisioning Workflow

    User creates a new stack from UI.

    Backend generates Terraform/Docker config.

    Save configs in a repo or local directory.

    Backend triggers Terraform apply (in a sandboxed environment).

    Capture output (e.g., bucket URLs, DB creds) and return to user.

    Optional: store outputs for future actions (e.g., destroy, upgrade).

📦 6. Storage and Output Handling

    Save config files per user/project (use Git or internal DB).

    Handle Terraform state securely and per deployment.

    Map outputs to UI-friendly format.

🔄 7. Lifecycle Management

    Create, Update, Destroy resources.

    Track state changes (via Terraform plans).

    Allow rollback or recreation of stacks.

    Notification system (email, push, etc).

📊 8. Observability

    Logging (Terraform runs, Docker outputs).

    Monitoring (infrastructure status, errors).

    Auditing (who deployed what, when).

⚙️ 9. Extensibility

    Support multiple providers (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean).

    Modular templates (e.g., plug-in system for services).

    Versioning of templates and deployments.

✅ 10. Testing and Validation

    Validate config before provisioning.

    Dry runs (terraform plan or test container builds).

    Automated test cases for templates.
