## 3. Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)

### 3.1 Process
1. Read the input QuantaQL query as a character stream
2. Identify and classify tokens according to the QuantaQL grammar
3. Eliminate whitespace and comments
4. Convert literals to internal representation
5. Handle character escaping in string literals

### 3.2 Token Types
- Keywords (e.g., FIND, MATCH, ADD, UPDATE)
- Identifiers (record names, field names)
- Literals (strings, numbers, booleans, date/time values)
- Operators (+, -, *, /, =, >, <, etc.)
- Delimiters (, ; . { } [ ] ( ))
- Special tokens (SCALAR, DOCUMENT, RELATION, METRIC)

### 3.3 Output
A token stream with position and type information for each token, ready for syntactic analysis.

## 4. Syntactic Analysis (Parsing)

### 4.1 Process

NAVIGATE tasks -> assignees:users
MATCH tasks.status = "pending" AND tasks.due_date < time("2025-06-01")
ORDER BY tasks.due_date ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Processing Steps:

1. **Tokenization and Parsing**:
   - Identify keywords: FIND, NAVIGATE, MATCH, ORDER BY, LIMIT
   - Build AST with query structure

     - tasks.status: PostgreSQL (SCALAR)
     - tasks.due_date: PostgreSQL (SCALAR)
     - users.username: PostgreSQL (SCALAR)
     - tasks -> assignees: Neo4j (RELATION)

3. **Query Planning**:
   - Determine operation order:
     1. Filter tasks by status and due_date (PostgreSQL)
     2. Navigate relationships to users (Neo4j)
     3. Fetch user details (PostgreSQL)
     4. Sort by due_date
     5. Apply limit

4. **Storage Engine Query Generation**:

   - PostgreSQL Query 1 (for tasks):
   ```sql
   SELECT t.id, t.title, t.status, t.due_date
   FROM tasks t
   WHERE t.status = 'pending' AND t.due_date < '2025-06-01'
   ORDER BY t.due_date ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   - Neo4j Query (for relationships):
   ```cypher
   MATCH (t:tasks)-[r:assigned_to]->(u:users)
   WHERE t.id IN $task_ids

   ```

   - PostgreSQL Query 2 (for users):
   ```sql
   SELECT u.id, u.username
   FROM users u
   WHERE u.id IN ($user_ids);
   ```

5. **Query Execution**:
   - Execute PostgreSQL Query 1 to get tasks
   - Pass task IDs to Neo4j Query
   - Execute Neo4j Query to get task-user relationships
   - Pass user IDs to PostgreSQL Query 2
   - Execute PostgreSQL Query 2 to get user details

6. **Result Assembly**:

MATCH tasks.status = "completed" 
      AND tasks.due_date > time("2025-01-01")
GROUP BY projects.name
HAVING COUNT(tasks) > 5
ORDER BY avg_completion DESC;
```

#### Processing Steps:

     - tasks.due_date: PostgreSQL (SCALAR)
     - tasks -> project: Neo4j (RELATION)
     - tasks.completion_time: InfluxDB (METRIC)

3. **Query Planning**:
   - Determine operation order:
     1. Filter tasks by status and due_date (PostgreSQL)
     2. Navigate to projects (Neo4j)
     3. Fetch project details (PostgreSQL)
     4. Fetch completion time metrics (InfluxDB)
     5. Aggregate and group results
     6. Apply HAVING filter
     7. Sort by average completion time

4. **Storage Engine Query Generation**:

   ```sql
   SELECT t.id, t.status, t.due_date
   FROM tasks t
   WHERE t.status = 'completed' AND t.due_date > '2025-01-01';
   ```

   - Neo4j Query (for tasks-project relationships):
   ```cypher
   MATCH (t:tasks)-[r:project]->(p:projects)
   WHERE t.id IN $task_ids
   RETURN t.id AS task_id, p.id AS project_id;
   ```

   - PostgreSQL Query 2 (for projects):
   ```sql
   SELECT p.id, p.name
   FROM projects p
   WHERE p.id IN ($project_ids);
   ```

   - InfluxDB Query (for completion metrics):
   ```
   SELECT mean("value") AS avg_completion
   FROM "tasks.completion_time"
   WHERE task_id IN ($task_ids)
   GROUP BY task_id;
   ```

5. **Query Execution**:
   - Execute queries in optimal order
   - Collect and store intermediate results

6. **Result Assembly**:
   - Join all results using record IDs
   - Group by project name
   - Count tasks per project
   - Calculate average completion time per project
   - Filter groups with task count > 5
   - Sort by avg_completion

7. **Response Formatting**:
   - Generate JSON with project names, task counts, and average completion times
