üìã Application Specification: ITGC Management Service
1. ‚ú® Purpose

A secure internal system for managing ITGC controls:

    Track system access

    Manage user permissions

    Review evidence artifacts

    Monitor change management

    Perform security monitoring

    Generate audit-ready reports

2. üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview
Layer	Technology
Frontend	React 18+, TailwindCSS, React Query
Backend	FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
Authentication	OAuth2 / SSO + MFA enforcement
Authorization	RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
Notification	Websockets + Email (for alerts)
Storage	PostgreSQL (core), S3-compatible (artifact storage)
Logging/Auditing	Structured logs (e.g., Loki, Cloudwatch)
Deployment	Docker, Kubernetes (optional)
3. üîí Key Security Requirements

    All actions are logged (audit trails).

    MFA enforced for all users.

    Fine-grained RBAC to separate Admin, Reviewer, Read-only users.

    All artifacts (logs, reports, backups) must have versioning and immutability where possible.

    Change Management must enforce approval workflow.

4. üß© Core Modules (React + FastAPI APIs)
Module	Description
User Management	Invite, onboard, and remove users; manage MFA; assign roles.
Access Control Review	Track, approve/reject access requests; quarterly review reports.
Change Management	Submit, review, and approve changes to code, infrastructure, access.
Security Monitoring	View privileged actions, suspicious logins, alert dashboard.
Evidence Management	Upload/collect evidence artifacts (backups, logs, reports).
Audit Reporting	Generate audit logs, export reports in PDF/CSV formats.
Notifications	Real-time alerts for critical actions (via UI and email).
Backup & Restore Tests	Manage backup tests, evidence capture for restores.
Physical Security Logs	Upload/access logs related to physical facilities.
5. üë®‚Äçüíª User Roles
Role	Abilities
Admin	Full access to all modules, user management, settings
Auditor	Read access to all records, export reports
Reviewer	Participate in approvals (access, change requests)
Contributor	Submit change requests, upload artifacts
Read-only	View data but cannot make changes
6. üõ§Ô∏è Critical User Flows
6.1 User Management Flow

    Admin logs in ‚Üí navigates to "User Management"

    Click "Invite User" ‚Üí enter email, role ‚Üí user receives invite

    User must enable MFA during first login

    User appears in user table, roles adjustable

    Deactivation option immediately revokes access

6.2 Access Review Flow

    Reviewer clicks "Access Reviews"

    List of users + permissions across systems

    Approve/Reject/Flag permissions

    Signed off access review saved as an artifact (PDF)

6.3 Change Management Flow

    Contributor opens "Change Requests"

    Submit a new change request ‚Üí description, system impacted, justification

    Reviewer(s) notified

    Reviewer(s) approve/reject

    Final status logged with timestamps

6.4 Evidence Upload Flow

    Contributor opens "Evidence Center"

    Choose category (e.g., Backup Test, Security Logs)

    Upload file or link to existing S3 artifact

    Evidence indexed by control area (e.g., OP-02)

6.5 Security Monitoring Flow

    Reviewer accesses "Security Events"

    Dashboard lists login attempts, privileged commands

    Filters: time range, severity, system

    Can mark events as "Reviewed" or "Flagged for Investigation"

6.6 Audit Reporting Flow

    Auditor clicks "Generate Report"

    Choose scope (e.g., last quarter, specific controls)

    Preview report in dashboard

    Export to PDF/CSV

    Optionally "lock" reports after generation for immutability

7. üõ†Ô∏è Backend Services (FastAPI)

    /auth/login

    /auth/mfa

    /users/

    /users/{id}/permissions

    /access_reviews/

    /changes/

    /evidence/

    /security_events/

    /reports/

    /notifications/

    /settings/

All routes protected by OAuth2 + RBAC middleware.
8. üì¶ Database Model Sketch

Tables

    users

    roles

    permissions

    systems

    access_reviews

    change_requests

    security_events

    evidence_files

    audit_logs

    notifications

    settings

(Relational with Foreign Keys; partitioned tables for logs/evidence if necessary)
9. üìà Future Enhancements

    Integrate with external SSO (Zitadel)

    Pre-built dashboards for CISO/CIO level views

    Automated quarterly compliance review scheduling

    Real-time security alerts via Slack / Teams integration

    "Smart" anomaly detection on login events (ML module)

‚úÖ This Spec Ensures:

    Full ITGC lifecycle visibility

    Secure, role-driven access

    Compliance audit-readiness

    Extendibility for future governance needs
