I want to design a [type of system/app], and I need a complete system specification. Please generate a detailed document that includes the following sections:

1. **Overview**
   - Brief description of the system/app
   - Key problem it solves
   - Target users or market

2. **Core Features**
   - List of main features
   - Purpose of each feature
   - Priority level (e.g., Must-have, Nice-to-have)

3. **User Roles**
   - Different types of users (e.g., Admin, Customer, Provider)
   - Capabilities and access levels for each role

4. **User Journeys**
   - Common workflows or scenarios for each user role
   - Highlight how users interact with the system

5. **System Architecture**
   - Suggested architecture style (e.g., Microservices, Monolith, Serverless)
   - Backend language/frameworks
   - Frontend tech stack
   - Database/storage options

6. **API & Integrations**
   - External services to integrate with (e.g., payment, auth, analytics)
   - Key internal/external API endpoints
   - Expected data formats (e.g., JSON, GraphQL)

7. **Security & Authentication**
   - Type of authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2)
   - Role-based access control, data privacy considerations

8. **Scalability & Performance**
   - Anticipated traffic/users
   - Caching, CDN, background jobs, load balancing strategies

9. **Deployment Strategy**
   - CI/CD pipeline overview
   - Cloud provider or hosting platform
   - Dev/staging/prod environments

10. **Monitoring & Maintenance**
    - Monitoring/logging tools
    - Health checks and alerts
    - Update/rollback strategy

11. **Legal & Compliance**
    - GDPR, HIPAA, or other regulations
    - Terms of service / privacy policy requirements

12. **Timeline & Milestones**
    - Estimated development timeline
    - Phases or sprints (if Agile)
    - MVP goals vs. future features

Please generate the specification in a clear and structured format (Markdown or JSON if applicable), and include diagrams or pseudocode examples where helpful.
