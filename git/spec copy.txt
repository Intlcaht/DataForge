N8N-Powered Sales Data Management Agent Specification
System Overview
This specification outlines an automated agent system built on n8n (a no-code workflow automation platform) that will:

Collect data from sales representatives via web forms
Transfer this data to individual Google Sheets
Consolidate the data into a master sheet on a schedule
Enable WhatsApp-based reporting and analytics

Detailed Components
1. Data Collection System
Web Form Creation:

Create separate web forms for each sales representative using n8n's Form trigger
Each form will have consistent fields for sales data entry:

Customer name
Product/service sold
Sale amount
Sale date
Additional notes
Territory/region
N/B Revised by Client

Each form will have a unique URL that can be shared with the specific sales rep

Data Flow:

Form submissions trigger an n8n workflow
The workflow identifies the sales rep based on the form source
Data is then routed to the appropriate Google Sheet

2. Google Sheets Integration
Individual Rep Sheets:

Create a separate Google Sheet for each sales representative
Each sheet has standardized columns matching the form fields
n8n's Google Sheets module writes new form submissions to the appropriate sheet

Master Sheet:

Create a master sheet that will contain all consolidated data
Include additional columns to track data source (which rep)
Set up proper formatting and conditional rules for better readability

3. Data Consolidation Workflow
Scheduled Execution:

Configure n8n to run a consolidation workflow on a defined schedule (crontab)
Example schedule: Daily at midnight (0 0 * * *)

Consolidation Process:

Workflow reads all data from individual rep sheets
Combines data into the master sheet
Preserves source information
Maintains data integrity with error handling
Updates timestamp of last consolidation

4. WhatsApp Integration
Setup:

Integrate with WhatsApp Business API through n8n
Create a dedicated business number for the agent
Configure webhook for incoming messages

Command System:

Create a natural language processing system using n8n's conditional workflows
Define specific keywords/commands the sales manager can use

Available Commands:

overview: Sends a summary of all sales data
stats: Provides basic statistical analysis
query [parameters]: Allows filtered data requests
today: Shows today's sales performance
week: Shows this week's sales performance
rep [name]: Shows performance for specific rep

5. Reporting Engine
Report Types:

Merged Report Overview:

Total sales amount
Number of transactions
Performance by rep (table format)
Comparison to previous period


Sample Statistics:

Average sale value
Highest and lowest sales
Sales distribution by territory
Top-performing products


Query-based Statistics:

Filter by date range
Filter by rep name
Filter by territory
Filter by product
Combinations of above parameters



Output Formatting:

Text summaries for quick insights
Data tables for detailed information
Simple charts (bar/pie) converted to images

Implementation Steps
1. Initial Setup

Create n8n account and set up workspace
Configure Google Sheets integration with proper permissions
Set up WhatsApp Business API connection

2. Workflow Creation

Build form submission workflows
Create data routing logic
Develop consolidation workflow with scheduler
Implement WhatsApp command processing

3. Testing

Test form submissions with sample data
Verify data routing to correct sheets
Confirm consolidation works properly
Test WhatsApp commands and responses

4. Deployment

Share form links with sales reps
Train sales manager on WhatsApp commands
Monitor system performance

Technical Architecture
n8n Workflows

Form Submission Workflow

Trigger: Form submission
Actions:

Parse form data
Identify sales rep
Write to appropriate Google Sheet
Send confirmation to rep


Data Consolidation Workflow

Trigger: Cron schedule
Actions:

Read all individual sheets
Process and normalize data
Update master sheet
Generate summary statistics


WhatsApp Command Workflow

Trigger: Incoming WhatsApp message
Actions:

Parse command
Execute relevant query
Format response
Send back to user

Security Considerations

All Google Sheet access requires proper authentication
Form access requires unique URLs (optional password protection)
WhatsApp communication is authenticated via the business number
Data is encrypted in transit
No sensitive customer data is stored in the system

Scalability
This solution can handle:

Up to 20 sales representatives
100+ daily transactions
5000+ records in the master sheet
Multiple WhatsApp queries per minute

For larger needs, consider:

Implementing pagination in the master sheet
Adding database storage for historical data
Creating an archiving system for older records

Maintenance Recommendations

Weekly backup of all sheets
Monthly review of workflow performance
Quarterly optimization of reporting templates
Annual review of data retention policies
