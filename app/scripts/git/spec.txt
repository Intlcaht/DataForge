Remote Versioning System Specification
Overview
This specification outlines a custom bash script that sets up a Git repository with enhanced remote management, submodules, Git flow, and proper initial configurations.
Features
Multiple Remote Origins
The script will support configuring multiple remote repositories:

Primary remote (public) - For open-source collaboration
Private remote - For sensitive code/features
Additional dynamic remotes - Configurable via parameters

Each remote will be properly configured with push/pull settings and appropriate access controls.
Git Submodules Management

Initialize and configure git submodules
Clone all required submodules during initialization
Set up proper tracking for submodules
Configure submodule update behavior

Git Flow Pattern Implementation

Initialize git-flow branching model
Set up standard branches:

main (production-ready code)
dev (integration branch)
feature/* prefix for new features
release/* prefix for release preparation
hotfix/* prefix for urgent fixes


Configure branch protection rules
Set up proper merge/rebase policies

Gitignore Setup

Create comprehensive .gitignore file
Include common patterns for various development environments
Add system files and temporary files that should be excluded
Support different gitignore templates based on project type

Branch Standardization

Rename default branch from master to main
Update all local references
Configure upstream to track the renamed branch

Initial Commit

Create initial README.md file with project description
Add basic project structure folders
Include boilerplate configuration files
Perform initial commit with standardized message

Script Parameters
The script will accept the following parameters:

Project name/path
Remote URLs (public, private, additional)
Project type (for gitignore template selection)
Submodule URLs and paths
Git flow configuration options
Initial commit message (optional)

Execution Flow

Validate input parameters
Create directory structure
Initialize git repository
Set up gitignore file
Rename main branch
Initialize git submodules
Configure multiple remotes
Set up git flow
Create initial project files
Perform initial commit
Push to configured remotes

Error Handling

Comprehensive error checking at each step
Rollback mechanism for failed operations
Detailed logging of all operations
User-friendly error messages

Extensibility

Configuration file support for reusable setups
Plugin architecture for custom extensions
Template system for project-specific configurations

Security Considerations

Secure credential handling
No hardcoded tokens or passwords
Support for credential helpers
Option for SSH key-based authentication

Performance Optimization
The script will optimize operations for:

Large repositories
Slow network connections
Limited resource environments
