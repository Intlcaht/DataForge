Okay, let's break down the development of the Icaht Sidecar into detailed tasks. We'll organize these tasks into logical phases to guide the development process.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality - Service Registration and Basic Proxying

This phase focuses on the fundamental ability of the sidecar to register services and create basic, un-enriched proxies.

**1. Project Setup and Core Architecture:**

* **Task 1.1: Choose Programming Language and Framework:**
    * Research and select an appropriate programming language (e.g., Go, Python, Java) based on performance, community support, and team expertise.
    * Choose a suitable web framework for building the API and proxying capabilities (e.g., Go's `net/http` or Gin, Python's Flask or FastAPI, Java's Spring WebFlux or Netty).
    * *Rationale:* This decision will impact the development speed, performance, and maintainability of the sidecar.
* **Task 1.2: Define Core Data Structures:**
    * Design the data structures to represent service information (name, version, endpoints, registration details, assigned port).
    * Define the structure for proxy configurations.
    * *Rationale:* Well-defined data structures are crucial for managing service metadata efficiently.
* **Task 1.3: Implement Service Registration API:**
    * Develop an HTTP API endpoint (e.g., `/register`) that microservices can use to register themselves.
    * Define the request and response formats for the registration API (e.g., JSON).
    * Implement logic to store registered service information in memory or a simple data store.
    * *Rationale:* This API is the entry point for services to become managed by the sidecar.
* **Task 1.4: Implement Basic Reverse Proxying Logic:**
    * Develop the core proxying functionality that can forward incoming requests to the target microservice.
    * Handle basic HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    * Forward headers and bodies.
    * *Rationale:* This is the fundamental mechanism for the sidecar to act as a proxy.
* **Task 1.5: Implement Dynamic Port Allocation:**
    * Develop a mechanism to automatically assign a unique port to each registered service's proxy.
    * Ensure port availability and prevent collisions.
    * *Rationale:* Unique ports are essential for isolating service proxies.
* **Task 1.6: Basic Proxy Startup and Shutdown:**
    * Implement logic to start a new proxy instance (listening on the assigned port) when a service registers.
    * Implement logic to stop and clean up the proxy when a service deregisters or fails.
    * *Rationale:* Manages the lifecycle of the individual service proxies.
* **Task 1.7: Initial Configuration Management:**
    * Implement a basic way to configure the sidecar (e.g., via environment variables or a simple configuration file) for initial settings like the registration API port range for dynamic port allocation.
    * *Rationale:* Allows for basic customization of the sidecar's behavior.

## Phase 2: Implementing Enrichment Features

This phase focuses on adding the core enrichment capabilities to the proxies.

* **Task 2.2: Design Authorization Middleware:**
    * Define the authorization mechanisms (e.g., RBAC based on token claims).
    * Implement logic within the authentication middleware or as a separate middleware to check user permissions based on the validated token and potentially service-specific rules.
    * *Rationale:* Ensures that only authorized requests reach the microservices.
* **Task 2.3: Configuration for Authentication/Authorization:**
    * Define how authentication and authorization rules will be configured for each service (e.g., via registration metadata, a separate configuration source).
    * Implement logic to load and apply these configurations to the proxy.
    * *Rationale:* Allows for service-specific security policies.

**3. Metrics Collection:**

* **Task 2.4: Integrate with a Metrics Library:**
    * Choose a suitable metrics library (e.g., Prometheus client libraries for the chosen language).
    * Implement logic to collect key metrics for each proxy (e.g., request count, latency, error rate).
    * *Rationale:* Provides observability into the performance of the services.
* **Task 2.5: Expose Metrics Endpoint:**
    * Implement an HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/metrics`) on each service proxy to expose the collected metrics in a format compatible with Prometheus.
    * *Rationale:* Allows Prometheus to scrape metrics from the sidecar.

**4. Distributed Tracing:**

* **Task 2.6: Integrate with a Tracing Library:**
    * Choose a distributed tracing library (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Zipkin client libraries).

    * *Rationale:* Allows monitoring systems to check the availability of the proxy.
* **Task 2.10: Implement Readiness Check Endpoint (Optional):**
    * Implement a `/ready` endpoint to indicate if the proxy is ready to serve traffic (e.g., after initialization).
    * *Rationale:* Provides a more granular view of the proxy's state.

**7. CORS Management:**

* **Task 2.11: Implement CORS Middleware:**
    * Implement middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) based on configuration.
    * Allow configuration of allowed origins, methods, and headers per service.
    * *Rationale:* Enables secure cross-origin requests when needed.

**8. Logging:**

* **Task 2.12: Integrate with a Logging Library:**
    * Choose a suitable logging library for the chosen language.
    * Implement logging of incoming requests, outgoing requests, responses, and errors within the proxy.
