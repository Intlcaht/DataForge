üîÅ Inter-Database Relationships & Workflow

    Users create Projects.

    Projects use Services from the itlc_api database.

    Users can bid on services and view bids.

    Providers create Orders from bids and update them via Checkins.

    Users pay for completed Projects.

    Providers can optionally create Blogs and FAQs.

    Users provide Ratings and Reviews.

    Providers can top up tokens, which updates user balances.

    Users can select Templates, which are used to create Projects and Services.

    Providers define Order Steps (Neo4j), which notify users via Notifications and connect to Orders.
